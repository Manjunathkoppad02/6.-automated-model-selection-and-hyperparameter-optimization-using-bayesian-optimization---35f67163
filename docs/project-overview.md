The Diabetes Prediction project aims to build an accurate and robust machine learning model that can predict whether a patient is likely to be diagnosed with diabetes. Leveraging the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset, this project uses Random Forest Classifier as the core model and explores multiple hyperparameter optimization techniques, including Grid Search, Randomized Search, Bayesian Optimization (Hyperopt), TPOT Genetic Programming, and Optuna, to significantly improve model performance.

This project demonstrates the complete machine learning pipeline â€” from data preprocessing and model training to advanced hyperparameter tuning and evaluation. It also highlights the use of automated ML techniques and cutting-edge optimization frameworks to develop a high-performing predictive model in the healthcare domain.

Key Focus Areas:

Real-world dataset with imbalanced features

Multiple optimization strategies for performance improvement

Model evaluation with precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix

Scalable, modular code suitable for deployment or integration

This project serves as a strong foundation for medical diagnostic tools and can be further expanded into a production-ready predictive service.
